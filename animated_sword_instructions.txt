HOW TO FIX THE LEGENDARY_SWORDN2 ANIMATION:

1. Your legendary_swordn2.png needs to be reformatted with multiple frames stacked vertically.

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Open your existing legendary_swordn2.png in an image editor (like GIMP, Photoshop, or Aseprite)
2. Create a new image with:
   - Same width as your original texture (e.g., 16 pixels)
   - Height = original height × number of animation frames (e.g., 16 × 8 = 128 pixels)
3. Copy your original texture and modify it slightly for each frame:
   - Frame 1: Original texture
   - Frame 2: Add slight glow effect
   - Frame 3: Increase glow
   - Frame 4: Maximum glow
   - Frame 5: Decrease glow
   - Frame 6: Slight glow
   - Frame 7: Original texture
   - Frame 8: Slight color shift

4. Place each frame vertically in the new image, one below the other
5. Save as legendary_swordn2.png, replacing the original file
6. Make sure legendary_swordn2.mcmeta is in the same directory with the animation settings

EXAMPLE MCMETA (already updated for you):
{
  "animation": {
    "frametime": 2,
    "interpolate": true,
    "frames": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
  }
}

Notes:
- "frametime": 2 means each frame displays for 2 game ticks (10 frames per second)
- "interpolate": true means Minecraft will blend between frames for smoother animation
- The "frames" array specifies the order in which frames are displayed

After making these changes, restart Minecraft to see the animated sword.
